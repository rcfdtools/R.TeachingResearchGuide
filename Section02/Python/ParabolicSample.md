### Parabolic trajectory projectile motion - Markdown example

Projectile refers to an object that is in flight after being thrown or projected. In a projectile motion, the only acceleration acting is in the vertical direction which is acceleration due to gravity (g). Equations of motion, therefore, can be applied separately in X-axis and Y-axis to find the unknown parameters.[^1]

$y = x\tan \theta  - \frac{{g{{(x)}^2}}}{{2{{(u\cos \theta )}^2}}}\$

Donde,

$g$ = gravity acceleration, $m/s^{2}$: 9.806000

$\theta$ = inclination angle, $°$: 60.000000

$u$ = initial projectile velocity, $m/s$: 9.436460
